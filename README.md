# Hangman Game

## Description
Hangman is a simple Python game where the player must guess a word letter by letter before running out of lives. The player starts with a certain number of lives, and with each incorrect guess, they lose a life. The game ends when the player guesses the word correctly or runs out of lives.

5. Follow the prompts to guess letters and try to reveal the hidden word.
6. You have a limited number of lives, so choose your guesses wisely!
7. If you guess the word correctly within the allotted lives, you win. Otherwise, you lose.
